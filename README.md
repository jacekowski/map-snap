# Map Snap

An app to capture images of maps generated on Arelplane.

### Getting started
* mapSnap is a node app, so you'll need to setup a node environment and get it running.
* Add a `.env` file to the root of the app and add your environment variables. Here is an example:
```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=ABC123
AWS_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=DEF456
AWS_BUCKET=AWS-BUCKED-NAME
API_KEY=GHI789
ARELPLANE_ROOT_URL=http://localhost:3000
MAPSNAP_ROOT_URL=http://localhost:8080
```
